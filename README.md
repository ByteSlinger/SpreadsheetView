# SpreadsheetView
A read-only SpreadsheetView framework and Demo apps for it

SpreadsheetView is a framework for iOS that uses a UITableView object, which contains UITableViewCell objects which contain UICollectionView objects.  Each UICollectionView object has UICollectionViewCell objects, each containing a UILabel object, which are the cells of the spreadsheet.

The UITableViewCell objects are the rows of the spreadsheet and the UICollectionViewCell objects make up the columns of the spreadsheet.  The scrolling is synchronized so the rows and columns line up, as they do in typical spreadsheet implementations.

Included in the repo is the SpreadsheetViewDemo app, which demonstrates how to use the SpreadsheetView framework.
